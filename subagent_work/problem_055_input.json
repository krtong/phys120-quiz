  "problem": "A novice skier, starting from rest, slides down a frictionless 13.0° incline whose vertical height is 125m. How fast is she going when she reaches the bottom? Use two approaches (a) Newton's 2nd law and kinematics equations (2) Energy conservation to solve this problem. These two approaches result in the same answer.",
