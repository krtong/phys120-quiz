  "problem": "Two blocks, with masses m₍A₎ and m₍B₎, are connected to each other and to a central post by cords. They rotate about the post at frequency f (revolutions per second) on a frictionless horizontal surface at distances r₍A₎ and r₍B₎ from the post. Derive an algebraic expression for the tension in each segment of the cord (assumed massless).",
