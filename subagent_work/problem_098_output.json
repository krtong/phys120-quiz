  "solution": "(a) Kinetic energy: K = ½ m v² (scalar, depends on v²)\nMomentum: p = m v (vector, depends linearly on v)\n\nSimilarities: Both depend on mass and velocity; both are zero when v = 0; both increase with speed; both describe motion of objects.\n\nDifferences: K is scalar with no direction, p is vector with direction; K scales with v², p scales linearly with v; K measures energy (units: J or kg·m²/s²), p measures quantity of motion (units: kg·m/s).\n\n(b) Conservation of energy applies when only conservative forces (gravity, spring forces) do work, or when nonconservative work is negligible. Use for: frictionless motion, gravitational potential energy problems, spring systems, elastic collisions.\n\n(c) Conservation of momentum applies to isolated systems with zero or negligible net external force (F_external = 0). Use for: all types of collisions (elastic and inelastic), explosions, recoil problems, interacting particles. Momentum is conserved even when kinetic energy is not (e.g., inelastic collisions)."
