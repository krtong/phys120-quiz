  "problem": "A pressure cooker is a sealed pot designed to cook food with the steam produced by boiling water somewhat above 100°C. The pressure cooker in Fig. 13–32 uses a weight of mass m to allow steam to escape at a certain pressure through a small hole (diameter d) in the cooker's lid. If d = 3.0 mm, what should m be in order to cook food at 120°C? Assume that atmospheric pressure outside the cooker is 1.01×10⁵ Pa.",
