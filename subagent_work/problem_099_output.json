  "problem": "Two blocks of mass m₁ and m₂ respectively are placed on a frictionless surface. The block m₂ is initially at rest, and attached with a spring of spring constant k on its back. The block m₁ is then given an initial speed v₀ and collides head onto the block m₂. (a) What is the maximum compression of the spring throughout the entire collision process? (b) Find the velocities v₁f and v₂f of the two blocks respectively after the collision process. What is the condition on m₁ and m₂ such that the block m₁ will move backwards after the collision?",
