  "problem": "Suppose the insulating qualities of the wall of a house come mainly from a 4.0-in. layer of brick and an R-19 layer of insulation, as shown in Fig. 14–19. What is the total rate of heat loss through such a wall, if its total area is 195 ft² and the temperature difference across it is 35 F°?",
