  "problem": "Rita goes skiing. She starts from the top of the track, and slides down from rest. The track has an inclination angle θ, length L, and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the ski and the track is μ₍k₎. Suppose Rita's mass is m. (a) Draw the free body diagram for Rita when she is on the inclined track. (b) Find the normal force between Rita and the track. (c) Find the kinetic friction between the ski and the track. (d) Find the work done by kinetic friction between the ski and the track. (e) Using work-kinetic energy theorem, find Rita's speed when she reaches the bottom of the track.",
