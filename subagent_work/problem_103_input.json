  "problem": "Consider an object with an co-axial structure, where the inner axis has a radius R₁ and the outer radius is R₂. Suppose a force F₁ is applied to the inner axis at a point shown in the figure and has a direction with an angle θ₁ with respect to the horizontal line; another force F₂ is applied on the outer radius at a point and direction shown in the figure, which has an angle θ₂ with respect to the horizontal line. The object is fixed so that it cannot move translationally, but is allowed to rotate about its central axis that is perpendicular to the radii. Suppose the object has a rotational inertia I with respect to the central axis, find the angular acceleration of the object. Specify both the magnitude and direction (CCW or CW).",
