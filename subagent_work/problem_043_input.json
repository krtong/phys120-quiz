  "problem": "Calculate the moment of inertia of the array of point objects shown in the figure about (a) the y axis, and (b) the x axis. Assume m=2.2 kg, M=3.4 kg, and the objects are wired together by very light, rigid pieces of wire. The array is rectangular and is split through the middle by the x axis. (c) About which axis would it be harder to accelerate this array?",
