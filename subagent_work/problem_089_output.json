  "problem": "A car of mass m is running on a banked circular track where the banked surface has an angle θ with respect to the horizontal line. The car moves with a horizontal radius R from the symmetric axis of the circular track. Assume negligible friction between the tires and the surface. The car runs at a constant speed. Find the speed v of the car in terms of the given variables and relevant physical constants.",
