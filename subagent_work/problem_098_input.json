    {
      "explanation": "(a) Both depend on mass and speed, but kinetic energy scales with v² and is scalar, whereas momentum depends linearly on v and is a vector. Both are zero when v = 0 and increase with speed.",
      "notations": "K uses v², p uses v; p has direction, K does not."
    },
    {
      "explanation": "(b) Mechanical energy is conserved when only conservative forces (gravity, springs, etc.) act or when nonconservative work is negligible.",
      "notations": "Use energy for frictionless motion, springs, gravitational potential changes."
    },
    {
      "explanation": "(c) Momentum is conserved for isolated systems with no external impulse, such as collisions or explosions; it applies even when kinetic energy is not conserved.",
      "notations": "Use momentum for collisions, recoil problems, or interacting particles."
