      "explanation": "Start with the fundamental work formula where F is the force, d is the displacement, and θ is the angle between the force and displacement vectors.",

    {
      "explanation": "Define the variables from the problem. The mass is m = 260 kg, the gravitational acceleration is g = 9.80 m/s², and the vertical displacement is Δy = 2.80 m. The gravitational force is F = mg acting downward.",
      "notations": "Given: m = 260 kg, g = 9.80 m/s², Δy = 2.80 m"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Since gravity acts downward and the pile driver falls downward, the force and displacement are in the same direction, so θ = 0° and cos(0°) = 1. The force is the gravitational force F = mg.",
      "notations": "W₍g₎ = (mg)(Δy)cos(0°) = mgΔy"

      "explanation": "Substitute the numerical values into the formula.",
