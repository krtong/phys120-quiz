  "problem": "The tires of a car make 75 revolutions as the car reduces its speed uniformly from 95 km/h to 55 km/h. The tires have a diameter of 0.80 m. (a) What was the angular acceleration of the tires? If the car continues to decelerate at this rate, (b) how much more time is required for it to stop, and (c) how far does it go?",
