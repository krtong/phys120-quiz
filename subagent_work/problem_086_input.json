  "problem": "Approximately how long should it take 8.2 kg of ice at 0°C to melt when it is placed in a carefully sealed Styrofoam ice chest of dimensions 25 cm × 35 cm × 55 cm whose walls are 1.5 cm thick? Assume that the conductivity of Styrofoam is double that of air and that the outside temperature is 34°C.",
