  "problem": "A 725-kg two-stage rocket is traveling at a speed of 6.60×10³ m/s away from Earth when a predesigned explosion separates the rocket into two sections of equal mass that then move with a speed of 2.80×10³ m/s relative to each other along the original line of motion. (a) What is the speed and direction of each section (relative to Earth) after the explosion? [Hint: υ₍rel₎ = υ₍A₎' − υ₍B₎'] (b) How much energy was supplied by the explosion? [Hint: What is the change in kinetic energy as a result of the explosion?]",
