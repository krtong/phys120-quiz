  "problem": "Two particles of mass m₁ and m₂ respectively, travels with an initial speed v₀ but with different angles as shown in the right figure. After the two collide, they both fly out with an angle 45° with respect to the horizontal. Find the final speed v₁ and v₂ of the two particles respectively. You can use sin(30°) = cos(60°) = 1/2, cos(30°) = sin(60°) = √3/2, and sin(45°) = cos(45°) = √2/2.",
