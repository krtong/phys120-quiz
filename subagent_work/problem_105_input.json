  "problem": "A pulley of mass m₁ and radius R is fixed on the ceiling. The rotational inertial of the pulley is given by I = ½m₁R². A block of mass m₂ is hang by a rope (assuming mass is negligible) that wraps around the pulley. Assume the rope does not slip on the pulley. (a) Find the constraint relation between the angular acceleration of the pulley and the vertical acceleration of the block. (b) Find the tension of the rope. (c) Find the acceleration of the block. (d) When the block falls a distance Δy, what is the angular speed of the pulley?",
