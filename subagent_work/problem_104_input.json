  "problem": "A small sphere of mass m is attached to a boom of length L (assume to have negligible mass) and is released from rest with an initial angle θ₀. (a) Find the torque exerted by gravity on the small sphere with respect to the hinge when it was released. (b) Show that the kinetic energy of the small sphere due to its translational motion is the same as its rotational kinetic energy with respect to the hinge. (c) Find the speed of the small sphere right before it hits the ground.",
