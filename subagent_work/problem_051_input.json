  "problem": "A uniform disk turns at 3.3 rev/s around a frictionless central axis. A nonrotating rod, of the same mass as the disk and length equal to the disk's diameter, is dropped onto the freely spinning disk, the figure. They then turn together around the axis with their centers superposed. What is the angular frequency in rev/s of the combination?",
