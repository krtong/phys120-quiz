      "explanation": "(a) Draw the free body diagram. The forces acting on Rita are: weight mg (downward), normal force N (perpendicular to slope), and kinetic friction f_k (opposite to motion, up the slope).",

      "explanation": "(b) Apply Newton's second law perpendicular to the slope. Since there is no acceleration perpendicular to the slope, the normal force equals the perpendicular component of weight.",
      "notations": "ΣF_perp = 0 ⇒ N - mg cosθ = 0 ⇒ N = mg cosθ"

    {
      "explanation": "(d) Calculate the work done by kinetic friction using W = Fd cosθ. The friction force is f_k, the displacement is L, and the angle between friction and displacement is 180° (friction opposes motion).",
      "notations": "W_f = f_k L cos(180°) = -f_k L"

      "explanation": "(e) Apply the work-energy theorem. The net work equals the change in kinetic energy. Since Rita starts from rest (v₀ = 0), the final kinetic energy is ½mv².",

      "explanation": "(e) Factor out common terms and solve for v.",
