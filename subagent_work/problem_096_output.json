  "problem": "A block of mass m is placed on a ramp whose inclination angle is θ. A constant force F is applied horizontally on the block and accelerates the block until the block reaches the highest point of the ramp. The block is initially at rest and at the bottom of the ramp. The length of the ramp is L. (a) Draw the free body diagram for the block. (b) Find the work done by the normal force between the block and the ramp. (c) Find the work done by the gravitational force. (d) Find the work done by the constant force F. (e) Using work-kinetic energy theorem, find the final speed of the block when it reaches the top.",
