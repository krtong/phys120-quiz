  "problem": "The right figure shows two blocks connected by a cord (of negligible mass) that passes over a frictionless pulley (also of negligible mass). The blocks have mass m₍A₎ and m₍B₎, respectively, with m₍B₎ < m₍A₎. The two blocks are initially at rest. If the block m₍A₎ falls over a height L, assuming the length of the rope is long enough, what is the work done on m₍B₎ by the gravitational force?",
