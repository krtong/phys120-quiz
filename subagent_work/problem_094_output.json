  "problem": "The right figure shows two blocks connected by a cord (of negligible mass) that passes over a frictionless pulley (also of negligible mass). The blocks have mass m₍A₎ and m₍B₎, respectively, with m₍B₎ < m₍A₎. The two blocks are initially at rest. If the block m₍A₎ falls over a height L, assuming the length of the rope is long enough, what is the work done on m₍B₎ by the gravitational force?",

    {
      "explanation": "Determine the displacement of block B",
      "notations": "Since block A descends by distance L and the blocks are connected by an inextensible cord over a pulley, block B must rise by the same distance L. Therefore, Δy₍B₎ = +L (upward)"

    {
      "explanation": "Apply the sign convention for work done by gravity",
      "notations": "Gravity acts downward on block B, but block B moves upward. Since force and displacement are in opposite directions, the work done by gravity is negative"
