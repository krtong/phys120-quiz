  "problem": "Suppose a 65-kg person stands at the edge of a 5.5-m diameter merry-go-round turntable that is mounted on frictionless bearings and has a moment of inertia of 1850 kg·m². The turntable is at rest initially, but when the person begins running at a speed of 4.0 m/s (with respect to the turntable) around its edge, the turntable begins to rotate in the opposite direction. Calculate the angular velocity of the turntable.",
