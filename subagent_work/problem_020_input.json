  "problem": "You are trying to decide between two new stereo amplifiers. One is rated at 75 W per channel and the other is rated at 120 W per channel. In terms of dB, how much louder will the more powerful amplifier be when both are producing sound at their maximum levels?",

      "explanation": "Assuming comparable speakers and efficiencies, sound level scales with acoustic power; take the decibel difference.",
