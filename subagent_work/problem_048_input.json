  "problem": "Two masses, m₍A₎ = 32.0 kg and m₍B₎ = 38.0 kg, are connected by a rope that hangs over a pulley (as in the figure). The pulley is a uniform cylinder of radius R = 0.311 m and mass 3.1 kg. Initially m₍A₎ is on the ground and m₍B₎ rests 2.5 m above the ground. If the system is released, use conservation of energy to determine the speed of m₍B₎ just before it strikes the ground. Assume the pulley bearing is frictionless.",
