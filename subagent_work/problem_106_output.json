  "problem": "This problem describes one experimental method for determining the rotational inertia of an irregularly shaped object such as the payload for a satellite. The right figure shows a counterweight of mass m suspended by a cord wound around a spool of radius r, forming part of a turntable supporting the object. The turntable can rotate without friction. When the counterweight is released from rest, it descends through a distance h, acquiring a speed v. Find the rotational inertia of the rotating apparatus in terms of r, v, h, m and g.",
