  "problem": "The right figure shows two blocks connected by a cord (of negligible mass) that passes over a frictionless pulley (also of negligible mass). The arrangement is known as Atwood's machine. The blocks have mass m₁ and m₂ respectively with m₁ < m₂. The two blocks are initially at rest. (a) If the block m₂ falls over a height h, assuming the length of the rope is long enough, what is work done on m₂ by the gravitational force? (b) Continue from part (a), what is the work done on m₁ by the gravitational force? (c) What is the net work done on the two-block system by gravity? (d) According to the work-kinetic energy theorem, W = ΔK. Is the kinetic energy gained by the block m₂ equal to your answer to part (a)? (e) Denote the tension force as T, find the work done on m₂ by the tension T when the block falls down by a height H. (f) Find the work done on m₁ by the tension T. (g) Find the final speed of the block m₂ after it falls over a height h. Express your answer in terms of m₁, m₂, g and h.",
